Some applications use text files to define blocks of data as well as data flow.
Having said that, editing those text files manually is error prone. This
package aims to assist the manipulation of such files without actually
editing them manually.

This package is used to retrieve the data in such text files as a Python
dictionary. This dictionary can then be tweaked by the user before it is
use to write down the text files again.

The package is fully customizable via Python modules so they can be adapted
to the user's needs.

This project is under development.
